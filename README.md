#Bootcamp Challenge One: Code Refactoring for Horiseon Marketing Website

#User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

#Acceptance Criteria
-Webpage meets accessibility standards
-HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-The image elements have accessible alt attributes
-The heading attributes fall in sequential order
-The title element is concise an descriptive

This challenge involved changing the title to be more descriptive of the company, fixing a broken image
link, removing unnecessary class selectors, condensing other class selectors, and reorganized order of CSS
to follow the order of the html structure.
